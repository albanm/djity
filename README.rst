Description
===========

Djity Portal (referred to as Djity to make things shorter), is an open source Web development framework and Website engine built on top of Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/). It's purpose is to help us (and maybe you !) build dynamic Web applications and publish them effortlessly on the Web.

Djity comes with a lot of things pre-processed for you: front-end site administration in AJAX, applications contained in tabulations, contextual portlets, skeletons for new applications and projects, shortcuts for asynchronous communications, Javascript libraries, a shared client and server side context dictionary, installation and documentation utilities, on page WYSIWYG HTML edition, easy internationalization, theming, etc.

A lot of the boilerplate stuff is taken care of. Applications can be exchanged and plugged on a server. That's nice, but of course there is a down side: all this comes with technical choices, constraints and an homogenized look and feel. Your choice !

We are focused on Web development using the latest standards (HTML5, CSS3, etc.), compatibility with older browsers is not a priority.

WARNING ! Djity is still in an early development phase. If you are willing to look into it you should be prepared for gaps in functionalities and documentation, and for the occasional bug.
