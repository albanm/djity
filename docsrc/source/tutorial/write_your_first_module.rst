**********************************
Write your first Djity application
**********************************

This tutorial is a mimic of the `django tutorial <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`_.
If you don't know it, you should read/try it first.

This tutorial is still in construction. The best solution for now is to build
a bare Djity application, test it and dissect it for understanding. Things are
actually quite straightforward for someone accustomed to Django, at least we hope so !

Install Djity and create a project
==================================

See the section on creating a development environment.

Create a bare Djity application
===============================

Djity comes with a skeleton of application. You can use it to create a new
application by running the following command ::

 djity-admin.py create_app /path/to/my/app

You should then follow instructions printed in the last lines of the
trace.
